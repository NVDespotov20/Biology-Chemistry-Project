	Quads:

The quadriceps, also known as the quads, are a group
of four muscles located in the front of the thigh.
They are responsible for knee extension and play
a significant role in lower body movements, such
as jumping, running, and squatting. The size and
definition of the quads are often targeted by
those who wish to improve their lower body strength
and overall athletic performance.
